Got a cute face, bet I'm looking pretty fragile
My attitude is twice my size, I'll meet you in the battle
I'll come around and knock you down, look out, prepare for damage
Black to the Pink, watch it out, we're pretty savage

Whenever we want it we get it
Whatever you do babe it's useless
And our hands are full of them fat checks
If you don't believe me, go fact check
Expectations higher
It's like fish in water
I'm a little I'm toxic
You've fallen, I'm foxy

I'll think about it twice
But it's so hard for me to be fake and act so nice
Please don't get me wrong
When you see me smiling it's just me playing along

This is who I'm cut out to be
But you now wanna test me
I'm seeing you right through it
You should've picked something easy
Oh, wait 'til I do when I
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ddu-du ddu-du du

Baby the path that I'm walking
Blackpink, four ways, see us going
North, south, east, west, yeah, we run it
And your bucket list, yeah, I bought it
Pulling you, pushing you's what I do best
'Cause I know, babe, I'm another bad girl
Don't care what you think, what anyone says, when the bass drops it's another banger

I'll think about it twice
But it's so hard for me to be fake and act so nice
Please don't get me wrong
When you see me smiling it's just me playing along

This is who I'm cut out to be
But you now wanna test me
I'm seeing you right through it
You should've picked something easy
Oh, wait 'til I do when I
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Ddu-du ddu-du du

What you gonna do when I come, come through with that, that uh, uh huh
What you gonna do when I come, come through with that, that uh, uh huh
Too hot, too hot, too hot like fire (ddu-du ddu-du du, ddu-du ddu-du du)
Too hot, too hot, too hot like fire (ddu-du ddu-du du, ddu-du ddu-du du)

I'll think about it twice
But it's so hard for me to be fake and act so nice
Please don't get me wrong
When you see me smiling it's just me playing along

This is who I'm cut out to be
But you now wanna test me
I'm seeing you right through it
You should've picked something easy

Oh, wait 'til I do when I
Hit you with that ddu-du ddu-du du
